  <div style="text-align:center;"> <h2> Indian wedding details </h2> </div>
  <p>India is a large and diverse country, and wedding traditions vary across regions, with one commonality - they are typically a multi-day event. Our wedding will be two days (October 11-12), which believe it or not, is on the shorter side.  </p>

    <ul> <li> <h4>Mehndi and Sangeet: Oct 11, 2022 </h4>

  <p>The first evening will be the Sangeet ceremony where there will be performances, songs, and dances – the floor will be open to any guest or family member who wants to perform, including the bride and groom themselves. Mehendi artists will be present during the Sangeet, decorating the hands of the bride and groom with ornate henna designs. The hands of the couple’s family members will be decorated with henna as well, along with any other guests who are interested. Dinner will be provided. </p>
</li>
<li> <h4>Haldi: Oct 12, 2022 </h4>
  <p>The morning of the second day will be the Haldi ceremony where the bride and groom's faces will be painted with turmeric that is believed to enhance the glow on their faces. </p>
</li>
<li> <h4>Shaadi: Oct 12, 2022 </h4>
  <p>The second evening will be the main wedding ceremony (Shaadi), officiated by a pandit, who will light incense, recite passages in Sanskrit, and bestow blessings upon the couple. The marriage is sealed once the bride and groom walk around the ceremonial fire 7 times. From there, food and dancing will continue into the night.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align:center;"> <h2> Israeli wedding details </h2> </div>

<p> Unlike Indian weddings, weddings in Israel are typically a one-day event. Our Israeli wedding will be on Oct 18, 2022</p>

  <ul> <li> <h4>Reception: 6:30 PM </h4>

<p> The evening will begin with a reception, as guests arrive to the wedding hall, grab some appetizers, and greet the couple and their families. </p>
</li>

  <li> <h4>Huppah ceremony: 7:30 PM </h4>

<p>Next up will be the marriage ceremony, which is traditionally officiated by a rabbi. The bride, groom and families will gather under the Huppah – a canopy supported by four pillars, symbolizing the home the couple will build together. The ceremony will include the exchange of wedding rings, sipping from a cup of ceremonial wine, and several blessings and vows, and will conclude with the traditional breaking of a glass by the groom. While our wedding will not adhere to all religious aspects of the ceremony, it will be inspired by these traditions and include most of these elements. </p>
</li>
<li> <h4>Dinner and dancing: 8:00 PM </h4>
<p>After the Huppah ceremony, the guests will be invited to sit around the table to enjoy a hearty dinner, followed by a night of dancing and celebration. </p>
</li>
</ul>

  <h2> Some common questions</h2> <br>
  <ul>
    <li> <p><b> Do I need a visa to go to India? </b>
      <br> Yes. An e-visa is available for passport holders of most countries (including Israel and US). The e-visa application process can be done completely online and does not require you to travel to the embassy or send in your passport. More information can be found <a href="https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html" target="_blank">here</a>
    </p></li>

    <li> <p><b> Do I need a visa to go to Israel?</b>
      <br> US passport holders do not require a visa to enter Israel. Indian passport holders need a B/2 tourist visa. This can be done by following the information here: <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/service/request_for_tourist_visa_b2" target="_blank">Israel tourist visa</a>. Please contact us if you are applying, as you may need additional information/documents from us as part of your application! For other passport holders, you can check <a href="https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/tourist-visa-table/en/2022_Foreign_Visa_to_Israel.pdf", target="_blank">here</a> if you need a visa.
    </p></li>

    <li> <p><b> What about gifts? </b>
      <br> It would be practically impossible for us to transport presents from India and Israel back to Boston, so we request that you do not bring physical presents. All we want is your presence and love! If you would like to give us a present, we would really appreciate if you made a donation to any of the following organizations: <a href="https://www.nanhikali.org/" target="_blank"> Nanhi Kali</a>, <a href="https://ashanet.org/" target="_blank">Asha for Education</a>, <a href="https://www.care.org/" target="_blank"> CARE.org </a>. Another, although highly discouraged, option is a monetary gift, as is customary in Israeli weddings.
    </p></li>

    <li> <p><b> What should I wear to the individual ceremonies of the Indian wedding?  </b>
      <br> We do not have a strict dress code for our guests. Indian garb is encouraged, although not required at all. For the Haldi event, the norm is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=haldi+ceremony&sxsrf=ALiCzsbD4dJVfWBPmrEYjwHNQlzR28Fphw:1652736673838&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj0w-fy--T3AhVFjYkEHX_MB4AQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1280&bih=689&dpr=2#imgrc=DCCA25QffuFnBM" target="_blank"> to wear yellow </a>. For all other ceremonies, please wear whatever is comfortable. If you would like to wear Indian garb and do not already have one, you can purchase it either online, e.g., Etsy or xx, or, purchase in the numerous local shops in New Delhi if you arrive a day or two earlier.
    </p></li>

    <li> <p><b> What should I wear to the Israeli wedding? </b>
      <br> There is no traditional garb required, please wear whatever is comfortable. Typically, people wear semiformal-to-formal attire, but Indian garb is also welcome.
    </p></li>

    <li> <p><b> What are some things to do in and around New Delhi? </b>
      <br> New Delhi is massive and there are many things to do there and many places to visit, such as Qutub Minar, Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Akshardham temple, Chandni Chowk and <a href="https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/delhi-ind-delhi-delhi.html" target="_blank">many more </a>. The Taj Mahal is a 3-4 hr drive away and there are several taxi services available to make a day trip.
    </p></li>

    <li> <p><b> What are some things to do in Israel? </b>
      <br> Israel is a beautiful country with many sites worth visiting. Thanks to its small size, you may be able to visit many of them depending on the duration of your stay. Some of the highlights include the historic and religious sites of Jerusalem, the nightlife of Tel-Aviv, the Dead Sea, and Eilat and the Red Sea. In the Haifa area, you may want to check out the Baha'i Gardens, the German Colony, as well as the beaches or the several walking trails on the Carmel Mountain.
    </p></li>

    <li> <p><b> What are the requirements regarding COVID-19 vaccinations? </b>
      <br> We request that all guests be fully vaccinated. If you can’t be due to a medical reason, please contact us so we can decide on appropriate testing and quarantine measures.
    </p></li>

    <li> <p><b> What are country-specific requirements regarding travel and COVID testing? </b>
      <br> We will update this answer closer to the date of the wedding with the most up-to-date information. Please check back in closer to the wedding dates.
    </p></li>

    <li> <p><b> What will the weather be like? </b>
      <br> In New Delhi, we anticipate moderate weather with maximum of 35°C/95°F and minimum of 20°C/68°F, with low chance of rain. In Israel, you can expect mild-to-warm weather, with a high of 30°C/85°F and a low of 18°C/65°F. There will be a moderate chance rain, so it may be a good idea to pack an umbrella or a light raincoat.
